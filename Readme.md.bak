# Incorporating Higher-order Structural Information for Graph Clustering
We use these codes to replicate the primary experiment from our paper. We will release all source codes for experiments and baselines once we have cleaned them up.

## Environments
+ Python 3.8
+ PyTorch 1.9.1

## Datasets
+ DBLP: https://dblp.uni-trier.de

## Code
+ HeroGCN.py: The main part of our model includes the training process.
+ test.py: test the clustering performance of our current model. 
+ utils.py: tools to load data from the datasets.
+ evaluation.py: code used to evaluate the clustering performance of our model.
+ pretrain.py: pretrain the autoencoder used in our model.

## Best Model
This folder contains our best trained models, which can be loaded directly for testing the clustering performance.

You can run our codes using either of the following commands: 

**'python test.py --name dblp'**
or **'python HeroGCN.py --name dblp'.** 

These commands will trigger the testing procedure or the training procedure for our model, allowing you to assess its efficiency using the DBLP or ACM dataset.
